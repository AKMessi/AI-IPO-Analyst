üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

A Google API Key with the Gemini 2.5 Pro model enabled. You can get one from Google AI Studio.

A Tavily API Key for the web search functionality. You can get one from the Tavily AI website.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/AKMessi/AI-IPO-Analyst.git

cd AI-IPO-Analysis-Agent

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
   
A virtual environment is recommended to keep dependencies isolated.

On macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

python -m venv venv

.\venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required packages using the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application requires API keys to function. Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project.

Create the .env file:

touch .env

Add your API keys to the .env file:

GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"

TAVILY_API_KEY="YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY_HERE"

Replace the placeholder text with your actual keys. The application uses python-dotenv to load these keys automatically.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Once the setup and configuration are complete, you can launch the Streamlit application with a single command.

streamlit run app.py

This will start the web server and open the application in your default web browser. You can now upload a DRHP PDF, enter the company name, and start the analysis.
